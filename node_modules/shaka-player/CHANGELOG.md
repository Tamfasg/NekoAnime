    - play() (replace with video.play)
    - pause() (replace with video.pause)
    - requestFullscreen() (replace with video.requestFullscreen())

Broken compatibility:
  - The license postprocessor callback is no longer given a Restrictions
    argument.  See Player.getRestrictions()/setRestrictions().
  - The suppressMultipleEvents flag has been dropped from DrmSchemeInfo, which
    changes the constructor signature.  This flag interfered with key rotation.

    the test app UI.
  - The library has been published on [npm] and [cdnjs].
